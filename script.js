    "If you are humble, your concentration will be very high. That's the way to go in sports.",
    "I wake up at 5am, by 6am I'm on the way to training. I come back and relax, have lunch, take a little nap, then train again at 4pm for an evening run. Then relax, dinner and bed at 9pm until the next day.",
    "Thinking positively and confidently changed my life. If you stay consistent and work hard, you can be successful for a long time.",

    "A race is a work of art that people can look at and be affected in as many ways they're capable of understanding.",
    "Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run.

    "It's hard to run a mile when you're not a miler and to kick when you've led all the way.",
    "If I lose forcing the pace all the way, well, at least I can live with myself. But if it's a slow pace, and I get beaten by a kicker who leaches off the front, then I'll always wonder, 'What if...?'",

    "No one will ever win a 5,000-meter by running an easy two miles. Not against me.",
    "People say I should be running for a gold medal for the old red, white and blue and all that bull, but it's not gonna be that way.",
    "I've been in international competition, and now I know what the big boys can do. You don't go out and just run. There's an offense and a defense.",

    "What I want is to be number one.",
    "I used to say, 'Hey, man, what kind of a stupid question is that?' to a newspaperman asking me heavy things right after a race when I'm still in an emotional state. Now I at least try to answer.",
    "When people go to a track meet, they're looking for something, a world record, something that hasn't been done before. You get all this magnetic energy, people focusing on one thing at the same time. I really get excited about it. It makes me want to compete even more.
